# Matlab source files for Robust Topological Interface Modes Via All-Dielectric One-Dimensional Photonic Crystals

This repository hosts the supplementary MATLAB scripts for the paper “Robust topological interface modes via all-dielectric one-dimensional photonic crystals”. The files are organized to be self-contained, well-documented, and easy to run on any MATLAB R2020b (or later) installation.
Contents
1. Code1.Dispersion.m

Computes and plots the band structure and transmission spectrum for the photonic crystal (PC1=P and PC2=Q).

2. E_Field_for_Scheme_1.m

Calculates and plots the electric-field distribution at the interface defect for Scheme 1.

3. E_Field_for_Scheme_2.m

Calculates and plots the electric-field distribution at the interface defect for Scheme 2.

4. E_Field_of_PQ.m

Computes the E-field distribution at the interface without defect.

5. Transmission_Scheme_1_Gap_1_TE.m

Generates the TE-polarized transmission spectrum for Scheme 1, focusing on Gap 1.

6. Transmission_And_Sensing_Scheme_2_Gap_1_TE.m

Generate the TE-polarized transmission spectrum for Scheme 2, focusing on Gap 1 tabulates the sensing parameteres.

Requirements

MATLAB R2020b or later

No additional toolboxes required (all scripts use core MATLAB scripts and functions only).
